# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Logistic-Regression
Predicting whether cancer is malignant or benign using Logistic Regression (Binary Class Classification) in Python

## Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in todayâ€™s society.

## Objectives
The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this i have used machine learning logistic regression algorithm to predict the discrete class of new input with the help of the scikit learn built-in dataset.
